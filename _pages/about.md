I am a data scientist and machine learning graduate with strong interests in applying machine learning techniques, statistical models, open source software, and cloud-based technologies to solve business problems.

With a background of IT and Engineering, reinforced by my Data Science course at General Assembly, Sydney and working as a Data Analyst at Verisk Information Technologies, I have strong foundation and experience of various projects in mathematical and statistical analysis, computer programming, data structures, algorithms and communicating my work to varied audiences.

My immediate goal is to work in a team where there is a lot of knowledge sharing and where I can implement my skills in Data Scientist/Analyst role constantly challenging myself and broadening my horizon.
